youtrack test
try something else
updated the manage youtrack service on github.
update Allowed Origins for youtrack rest api settings
regenerated tho OAuth token
changed to @mcneel.com email address
allow all origins
change git user.name to "alain"
changed Manage Youtrack (from github) username back to "alain" from "alain@mcneel.com"
try this comment: "aoeu #RH-30450 Fixed"
try "Closed" instead.
That worked!  Let's try a few more things.
remove mcneel email from github and see if this works.
completely remove mcreel email from gh account.
change user.email in repo
reset user.email to match youtrack
how about a tag?
